              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alexandre Gustave Eiffel (born Dec. 15, 1832, Dijon, France—died Dec. 28, 1923, Paris) was a French civil engineer. A graduate of École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, he made his name with various bridges for the French railway network, most famously the Garabit viaduct. 
              <br><br><br>
              He is best known for the world-famous Eiffel Tower, built for the 1889 Universal Exposition in Paris, and his contribution to building the Statue of Liberty in New York. After his retirement from engineering, Eiffel focused on research into meteorology and aerodynamics, making significant contributions in both fields.

            Despite all the uproar, the frail iron tower would nonetheless see the day. To understand the history of the Eiffel Tower, it is important to know that its construction followed different steps. The construction itself lasted two years.

June 1884 : The project began and the first drawings were done.
January 28th, 1887 : The works begin.
April 1st, 1888 : The first stage was completed.
August 14th, 1888 : The second stage was completed.
March 31st, 1889 : The third and final stage in which the tower was completed in its entirety ended.
The Eiffel Tower was inaugurated on March 31, 1889. Gustave Eiffel walked the 1,710 steps to the top of the Tower to place the tricolored French flag at its summit. At the time, the Tower was 312 meters high.

              When the project came to being, it had been established that the licensing rights linked to the convention for the tower’s construction would last only 20 years, followed by imminent destruction. However, two million people visited the Tower during the Universal Exposition. Following this incredible success, the building became a symbol of French industrial power. The Tower was as equally as successful during the 1900 Universal Exposition. Determined to avoid the Tower’s destruction, Gustave Eiffel went to great lengths to prove its scientific utility. Scientific experiments were conducted in the fields of astronomy and physiology but what would really save the Tower in the end was its use as a radio antenna tower, first for military communications and then for permanent, radiotelegraphy communications; in fact, the Tower served many a purpose during the First World War. The Eiffel Tower is part of the French History.

              Every year approximately 7 million visitors climb the Tower. Its success is such that many countries all over the world have replicated the Tower more or less identically to the original one. Can you really imagine Paris without the Eiffel Tower? During your stay in Paris, don't miss the Eiffel Tower light shows that have been delighting the tourists and Parisians since the end of the XIXth century.
